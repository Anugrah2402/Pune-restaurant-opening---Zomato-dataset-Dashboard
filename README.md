# Key Takeaways from Data:

### Key Takeaways from Chart 1:
Bakery, Caf√©, Fine dining, Food courts, Food trucks Bar & dining, Desert parlor & Sweet shops, club and pubs are restaurant categories where there is a very high opportunity for opening restaurant business due to lack of competition.

### Key Takeaways from Chart 2:

Opening a restaurant which caters to these areas can be highly beneficial.

### Key Takeaways from Chart 3:
Areas such as Bopkhel, Khandala, Koregaon Bhima, Talawade etc. have minimum Zomato reviews.
Therefore, opening a restaurant which caters to these areas will not be profitable.

### Key Takeaways from Chart 4:
There is a huge scope of opening restaurants offering Excellent (5 star) Quality restaurants in areas such as Wakad, Pimple Saudagar, Kothrud, Kharadi, Hinjawadi and Hadapsar.
This is because in these areas people have given more 4 star reviews as compared to 5 star reviews to the restaurants.

### Key Takeaways from Chart 5:

These restaurants can cater to urban upper-class, high-earning groups of people residing in posh localities.
